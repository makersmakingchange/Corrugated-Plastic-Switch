# Corrugated Plastic Assistive Switch

## Overview
The Corrugated Plastic Switch works well for users looking for a large surface for targeting at a low cost. The switch is made from simple materials and can be replicated and modified easily. The switch works as a simple on or off button while attached to an electronic toy or appliance. When given access to a switch, the user becomes an active participant in accessing the item and is able to use the switch to interact with the device.

## How To Use
The Corrugated Plastic Switch is ideal for users looking for a temporary assistive switch to test sizing and activation forces. This switch also works well as a quick replacement if an existing switch breaks. Users with difficulty targeting switches may find this device helpful with its larger surface area.
